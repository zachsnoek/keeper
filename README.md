# Keeper

## Description
Keeper is a Google Keep clone built with the MERN stack. The concept and design are from Angela Yu's [Udemy course](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-web-development-bootcamp/). The original project from the course is a React app; I built out the backend and added some more functionality to it. In particular, I added a database, API, and the ability to edit notes.

## Installation
* Start MongoDB
* Add `MONGO_URI` to `config/config.env`

```bash
$ npm i
$ npm run start
```

## Future Improvements
This project was built to help me learn React and is not fully complete. In the future, I would like to add Google OAuth authentication and complete the API.
